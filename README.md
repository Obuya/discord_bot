# discord_bot
a quick discord bot that i made to kill sum time. 

custom feature that is unique to this is that once a user joins a voice channel the user will receice a vc role and gain access ro a vc - text channel. this channel is created once a user joins a vc and will be deleted after the last user leaves a vc. only users in a vc can see the channel.
